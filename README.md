# Arduino-Robot
Code for a four-wheeled mobile robot with edge detection, obstacle avoidance, and line following. The Robot is also capable of finding IR targets and shooting at them with a laser. It has two modes: Careful Mode for careful navigation, and Turbo Mode as a less cautious seek-and-destroy.
